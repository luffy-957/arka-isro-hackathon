# ARKA – Halo CME Detection
Arka is a scientific data analysis project focused on detecting **Halo Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)** events using **solar wind particle data** collected by the **SWIS-ASPEX payload onboard the Aditya-L1 mission**. Our goal is to contribute to an early warning system that can predict space weather events before they affect Earth and its orbiting satellites.
## 🌌 Project Motivation

The Sun drives solar particle flux, and sudden surges—especially those associated with **Halo CMEs**—can significantly disturb Earth's upper atmosphere and impact critical space infrastructure. By analyzing **Aditya-L1’s Level-2 particle data**, we aim to identify such events and visualize their particle flux characteristics.
